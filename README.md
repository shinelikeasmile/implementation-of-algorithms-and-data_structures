This repository contains the implementations of algorithms and data structures written in c++ and python.

# Introduction to Algorithms Analysis
- A data type in a programming language is a set of data with predefined values.
  - examples : integer,floating point,character,string,etc.
  - There are two data types:
    1. *System-defined data types* (primitive data types)
      - Data types that are defined by system.
      - examples : int,float,char,double,bool,etc.  
    2. *User-defined data types*
      - Data types that are defined by user.
      - examples : structures,classes.

- Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently
  - There are two types in data structures:
    1. *linear data structures* : elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not necessary to store sequentially.
      - examples : linked lists,stacks,queues,etc.
    2. *non-linear data structures* : elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order.
      - examples : trees and graphs.

- Abstract data types(ADTs) : Data structures with their operations.
  - An ADT consists of two parts:
    1. Declaration of data
    2. Declaration of operations
  - examples : Linked lists,Stacks,Queues,Binary trees,etc.

- Algorithm : an algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.
  - Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is the most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.
  - Running time analysis is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem(input size)       increases.

- Types of Analysis
  - *worst case* : input for which the algorithm takes long time
  - *best case* : input for which the algorithm takes least time
  - *average case* : input for which the algorithm takes average time
  
- Asymptotic notation
